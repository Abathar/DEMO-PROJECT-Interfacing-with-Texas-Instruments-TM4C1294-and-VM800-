# DEMO-PROJECT-Interfacing-with-Texas-Instruments-TM4C1294-and-VM800-

### This is a project to get a deepply understanding of the microcontroler TM4C1294 from Texas Instruments with the digital screen VM800.

The following problem is posed: Resolve the conflicting traffic flow of a maritime canal where passage is only possible in one direction and there is no space for vessels to cross in both directions simultaneously. The proposed solution is the implementation of two terminals at the beginning and end of the narrowing, which will record the passage of vehicles and display on the VM800 screen the vessels waiting to pass, whether they are in the canal or are outside but have booked a trip with the company at a specific time.
